After installing lm-sensors
```
root@quirquincho:~# sensors-detect
# sensors-detect version 3.6.0
# System: Default string Default string [Default string]

# Processor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) Silver N6005 @ 2.00GHz (6/156/0)

This program will help you determine which kernel modules you need
to load to use lm_sensors most effectively. It is generally safe
and recommended to accept the default answers to all questions,
unless you know what you're doing.

Some south bridges, CPUs or memory controllers contain embedded sensors.
Do you want to scan for them? This is totally safe. (YES/no):

Some Super I/O chips contain embedded sensors. We have to write to
standard I/O ports to probe them. This is usually safe.
Do you want to scan for Super I/O sensors? (YES/no):

[........................]


Now follows a summary of the probes I have just done.
Just press ENTER to continue: 

Driver `coretemp':
  * Chip `Intel digital thermal sensor' (confidence: 9)

Driver `to-be-written':
  * ISA bus, address 0xa30
    Chip `ITE IT8613E Super IO Sensors' (confidence: 9)

Note: there is no driver for ITE IT8613E Super IO Sensors yet.
Check https://hwmon.wiki.kernel.org/device_support_status for updates.

To load everything that is needed, add this to /etc/modules:
#----cut here----
# Chip drivers
coretemp
#----cut here----
If you have some drivers built into your kernel, the list above will
contain too many modules. Skip the appropriate ones!

Do you want to add these lines automatically to /etc/modules? (yes/NO)

Unloading cpuid... OK
